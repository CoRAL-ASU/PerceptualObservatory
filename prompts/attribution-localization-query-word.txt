**INSTRUCTIONS**
You are given an image of size 1024x1024 that was generated from the above support image. The image contains a sequence of characters clearly written, distorted, stylized, or blended with the environment (background or object) as a visual illusion.

**TASK**
Think and analyze the image carefully. Using the support context as a reference, detect the sequence of characters and provide a single bounding box that encloses all of its characters with detailed reasoning.

Return the result as a valid JSON list. If no sequence is confidently located, return empty list [].

**JSON output format**
```json
{
    "sequence": "The sequence of characters you read and detected",
    "reasoning": "Explain the visual evidence for this detection.",
    "x1": int,
    "y1": int,
    "x2": int,
    "y2": int
}
```
