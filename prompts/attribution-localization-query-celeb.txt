**INSTRUCTIONS**
You are given an image of size 1024x1024 that was generated from the above support image. A face is present in this image. The face might be clearly visible, perturbed, stylized, or blended with the environment (background or object) as a visual illusion.

**TASK**
Think and analyze the image carefully. Using the support context as a reference, detect the bounding boxes and provide detailed reasoning for each discernable facial attributes:
1. Left Eye
2. Right Eye
3. Nose
4. Mouth

Return the result as a valid JSON list. Your reasoning must explain how you identified the attribute, and only include the attribute that you can detect. If no attributes are confidently located, return empty list [].

**JSON output format**
